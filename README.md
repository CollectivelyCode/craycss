# craycss
A dark theme oriented CSS library.

## Mobile first? 
No. We actually don't focus on mobile at all and we don't really want to focus on it.

## Discord themed?
To get a feel of what we want it to look like, check out https://discordapp.com/

## CDN?
Not yet but hopefully soon.

Just add it as a stylesheet, not any different from Bootstrap or other CSS libraries and visit the craytesting.html for examples.
